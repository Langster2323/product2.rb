<!-- Created a rails repository: rails new product --api -->

<!-- Created a table: rails generate model product name:string price:integer condition:text on_clearance:integer quantity:integer -->

 <!-- Created a folder within the view folder called Product, I then created two action.html.erb files. -->

<!-- Setting up validations. -->

<!-- #Created a product controller with it's actions and it inherited an application controller. -->
